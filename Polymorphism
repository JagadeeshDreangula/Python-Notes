* Polymorphism is taken from the Greek words Poly (many) and morphism (forms).
* It means that the same function name can be used for different types. This makes programming more intuitive and easier.
* In Python, we have different ways to define polymorphism. So letâ€™s move ahead and see how polymorphism works in Python.
