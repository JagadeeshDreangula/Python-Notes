                                                Tuple
                                           .................
Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary,
 all with different qualities and usage.
A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
E.g:
t=()
    mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
    print(mytuple)

Tuple Items:
            Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.
Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.
Ordered:When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
Unchangeable:Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.
Allow Duplicates:
        Since tuples are indexed, they can have items with the same value
Create Tuple With One Item:
            To create a tuple with only one item, you have to add a comma after the item, otherwise Python will not recognize it as a tuple.
E.g:tpl = ("apple",)
    print(type(tpl))

 tuple() :
            It is also possible to use the tuple() constructor to make a tuple.
 E.g:thistuple = tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
    print(thistuple)

 Access Tuple Items:
                    You can access tuple items by referring to the index number, inside square brackets:
eg:mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(mytuple[1])


packing a Tuple:
                When we create a tuple, we normally assign values to it. This is called "packing" a tuple
                E.g: fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
Unpacking a Tuple:
                To extract the values back into variables. This is called "unpacking"
                E.g:fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
                (green, yellow, red) = fruits
                print(green)
                print(yellow)
                print(red)

Using Asterisk*:
                If the number of variables is less than the number of values,
                you can add an * to the variable name and the values will be assigned to the variable as a list
                E.g:fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "strawberry", "raspberry")
                    (green, yellow, *red) = fruits
                    print(green)
                    print(yellow)
                    print(red)

Note:If the asterisk is added to another variable name than the last,
Python will assign values to the variable until the number of values left matches the number of variables left.
Eg:
    fruits = ("apple", "mango", "papaya", "pineapple", "cherry")
    (green, *tropic, red) = fruits
    print(green)
    print(tropic)
    print(red)

 min():
        These functions return min value in the given tuple
        t=14,2,8,9,10
        print(min(t))
max():
        These functions return max value in the given tuple
        t=14,2,8,9,10
        print(max(t))
