                                        VARIABLES
                                    >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
*Variables are containers for storing data values.
E.g:
name='jagadeesh'
class='python'
a=1.5
python='is a programming language'
*Python has no command for declaring a variable.
*A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
*Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.

Casting:-
    If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
Example:
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3.5)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0
myName='jagadeesh'  #camel case
my_name='jagadeesh'  #snakecase
MyName='jagadeesh   #pascalcase

type():to check the type of variable
syntax:print(type(variable_name))
id():to check address of object
syntax:print(id(variable_name))
